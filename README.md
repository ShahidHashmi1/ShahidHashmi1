<ul>
<li>My name is Shahid Hashmi, and I'm excited to be starting out on my software developer journey.</li>
<li>I'm currently based out of Pittsburgh, PA, USA - but spend a large portion of the year in Columbus, OH, USA.</li>
<li>I love to travel and spend time in the outdoors!</li>
<li>I completed a full-stack web development bootcamp through 2U and The Ohio State University. This program went through the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Although I am confident in the principals of this stack, I am very eager to learn new languages and tech stacks moving forward to expand my programming knowledge and capabilities.</li>
<li>I am currently working in my first software deveolper role as a jr. dev. I'm navigating this journey and trying to soak up as much as possible.</li>
<li>I would love to connect with likeminded individuals looking to learn or teach some skills, collaborate on programming, or people who are passionate about the community we're in.</li>
  <p>Thank you!</p>
